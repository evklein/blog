Sometimes when ChatGPT is down I'll resort to using Copilot for more 'generic' requests. Copilot has more guardrails around it, making it impractical for any work that isn't software development, so sometimes you'll run into something like this:

This is a silly example, but Copilot has burned me a couple of times on things like this. Thankfully, there's an easy way to fight back.

```c#

    string meaningOfLove =
        """
            The meaning of love varies among different people and cultures. It's a complex and 
            powerful emotion that can be hard to define as it encompasses a range of feelings and attitudes.
        """;
    
```

Not a very good answer, but still. Checkmate, Copilot.
